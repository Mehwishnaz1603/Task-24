//More Conditional Tests: You don’t have to limit the number of tests you create to 10. If you want to try
// more comparisons, write more tests. Have at least one True and one False result for each of the following:
//• Tests for equality and inequality with strings
//• Tests using the lower case function
//• Numerical tests involving equality and inequality, greater than and less than, greater than or equal to, and less than or equal to
//• Tests using "and" and "or" operators
//• Test whether an item is in a array
//• Test whether an item is not in a array
